[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9abepvls6jexapqy/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/SoapyMan/redriver2-10jm8/branch/master)

Start Date: 28 March 2019

### Information
- Game was completely disassembled and reverse-engineered from MIPS back to C (except Memory Card menu overlay)
- Game has been *significantly improved over the original Playstation version*, original bugs was fixed and completed some unfinished gameplay aspects
- Utilizes [Psy-X (Psy-Cross) (formely extended TOMB5 emulator)](https://github.com/OpenDriver2/REDRIVER2/tree/master/src_rebuild/PsyX) as a layer for porting from Playstation
- Runs on Windows, Linux and soon to be on the other platforms (including backport to Playstation), no emulation involved
- Basic modding support - with textures and models replacement provided with [OpenDriver2Tools](https://github.com/OpenDriver2/OpenDriver2Tools)

### What to expect from it
- ***OpenDriver2*** project - complete rewrite with lots of new features such as *new renderer and sound engine, Lua scripting, Driver 1 content support*

### How is it done?
- All information (variables, types and function names) have been obtained from debugging symbols (.SYM), driver_psx_level and DLE
- Ghidra project (based on Italian SYM) to deal with overlays, simple code complex branching - semi-auto decompilation
- IDB based on Spanish SYM when dealing with things Ghidra can't handle properly - manual decompilation (mostly GTE code)
